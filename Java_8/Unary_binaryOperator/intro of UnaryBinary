The UnaryOperator Interface<T> is a part of the java.util.function package which has been introduced since Java 8, to implement functional programming in Java. It represents a function which takes in one argument and operates on it. However what distinguishes it from a normal Function is that both its argument and return type are the same.

Hence this functional interface which takes in one generic namely:-

T: denotes the type of the input argument to the operation
Hence the UnaryOperator<T> overloads the Function<T, T> type. So it inherits the following methods from the Function Interface:
