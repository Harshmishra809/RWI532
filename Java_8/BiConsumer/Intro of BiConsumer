The BiConsumer Interface is a part of the java.util.function package which has been introduced since Java 8, to implement functional programming in Java. It represents a function that takes in two arguments and produces a result. However, these kinds of functions doesnâ€™t return any value.

This functional interface takes in two generics, namely:- 

T: denotes the type of the first input argument to the operation
U: denotes the type of the second input argument to the operation
The lambda expression assigned to an object of BiConsumer type is used to define its accept() which eventually applies the given operation to its arguments. 

BiConsumers are useful when it is not required to return any value as they are expected to operate via side-effects.
