Lambda Expressions are introduced in Java SE8. These expressions are developed for Functional Interfaces. A functional interface is an interface with only one abstract method. To know more about Lambda Expressions click here.

Syntax:

(argument1, argument2, .. argument n) -> {

// statements

};

Here we make use of the Runnable Interface. As it is a Functional Interface, Lambda expressions can be used. The following steps are performed to achieve the task:

Create the Runnable interface reference and write the Lambda expression for the run() method.
Create a Thread class object passing the above-created reference of the Runnable interface since the start() method is defined in the Thread class its object needs to be created.
Invoke the start() method to run the thread.
