Hibernate is a framework that provides some abstraction layer, meaning that the programmer does not have to worry about the implementations, Hibernate does the implementations for you internally like Establishing a connection with the database, writing queries to perform CRUD operations, etc. It is a java framework that is used to develop persistence logic. Persistence logic means storing and processing the data for long use. More precisely Hibernate is an open-source, non-invasive, lightweight java ORM(Object-relational mapping) framework to develop objects which are independent of the database software and make independent persistence logic in all JAVA, JEE.
