We know that it is not possible to create an object of an interface in Java. Therefore, for instantiation, we need a class that implements the Deque interface, and that class is ArrayDeque. It grows and shrinks as per usage. It also inherits the AbstractCollection class.

The important points about ArrayDeque class are:

Unlike Queue, we can add or remove elements from both sides.
Null elements are not allowed in the ArrayDeque.
ArrayDeque is not thread safe, in the absence of external synchronization.
ArrayDeque has no capacity restrictions.
ArrayDeque is faster than LinkedList and Stack.
