n Java, Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with a single abstract method is called a functional interface). Lambda Expressions in Java are the same as lambda functions which are the short block of code that accepts input as parameters and returns a resultant value. Lambda Expressions are recently included in Java SE 8. 

Functionalities of Lambda Expression in Java

Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
